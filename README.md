This repository contains Swift version of the iOS game. You can find the game on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/word-fall-a-game-of-words/id1665721593).

I wasn't content with the app's architecture so I am rewriting it more cleaner and modular way [here](https://github.com/eigom/WordFall-Clean).

## Tech used

RxSwift, SpriteKit, StoreKit, UIKit, MVVM+Coordinators, SQLite, Python.
